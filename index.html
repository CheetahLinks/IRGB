        <p>Welcome to the IRGB Intelligence Test.</p>
        <p>This is a cognitive profiling system designed to reflect how your mind expresses intelligence‚Äînot how much of it you have. Your answers are anonymous and no personal information is stored or tracked. You‚Äôll be shown a series of short questions, each with multiple choice answers. At the end, you‚Äôll get a unique color profile representing your thinking style.</p>
        <p>Click the button below to begin.</p>
        <button id="short-btn">Start Short Test (20 questions)</button>
        <button id="long-btn">Start Long Test (100 questions)</button>
        <p>Note: This test is not a measure of your IQ. It‚Äôs a measure of how you think.</p>

            <h3>üß† What Does This All Mean?</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike traditional IQ tests that reduce your intelligence to a single number based on narrow, timed logic puzzles, 
                <strong>IRGB</strong> is built to be <em>better than IQ</em> ‚Äî because it reflects how your mind actually thinks.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Your <strong>color</strong> represents the <em>flavor</em> of your intelligence ‚Äî a unique blend formed from how your mind engages with different types of thinking:
                <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; padding-left: 1.2rem;">
                    <li><strong style="color: #D33;">Red</strong> ‚Äì Free-thinking, abstract, exploratory, and nonconformist.</li>
                    <li><strong style="color: #2A2;">Green</strong> ‚Äì Artistic, emotionally intuitive, and metaphorically expressive.</li>
                    <li><strong style="color: #26F;">Blue</strong> ‚Äì Logical, structured, focused, and conventionally trained.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
          
            <p>
                This final color reflects the <em>total presence</em> of each thinking style in your responses ‚Äî not just which you got ‚Äúright,‚Äù but which you leaned toward naturally. 
                It‚Äôs possible to think like a Red while coloring like a Green. That‚Äôs not a contradiction ‚Äî it‚Äôs insight.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Your <strong>intensity</strong> reflects how <em>clearly and consistently</em> you aligned with each style when it was targeted. 
                If you're looking for something similar to a traditional IQ score, intensity is your closest match ‚Äî but without the bias. 
                It doesn't measure how many answers you got right. It measures how fully your thinking matched its intent.
            </p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <strong>IRGB is smarter than IQ</strong> ‚Äî not because it tells you how smart you are, 
                but because it shows you <em>how</em> you're smart.
