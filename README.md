# IRGB

## IRGB — Intelligence Red Green Blue
IRGB is a cognitive profiling system that aims to redefine how we understand intelligence.

Rather than reducing intellect to a single number like traditional IQ tests, IRGB maps your thinking style and mental clarity using a more expressive and nuanced approach — through color and intensity.

## Why IRGB?
Most intelligence testing today relies on rigid, outdated systems that emphasize correctness over creativity, structure over expression, and standardization over individuality.

IRGB was created to explore a more human-centered question:

Not how smart are you?
But how does your mind naturally think?

## How It Works
You’re presented with a series of carefully designed questions. Each one targets a particular style of thought and contributes to an overall _“mindprint”_ made of three components:

🟥 **Red** – Free-Thinking
Abstract, nonlinear, exploratory, and unbound by tradition.

🟩 **Green** – Expressive Intelligence
Emotionally intuitive, artistically inclined, and metaphorically rich.

🟦 **Blue** – Structured Intelligence
Logical, consistent, system-oriented, and technically grounded.

Your selections contribute weighted values to each color channel (R, G, B), forming a unique hex color code that reflects your cognitive disposition.

## Intensity = Clarity of Expression
Alongside your color, IRGB also calculates an intensity score — representing how strongly and consistently your thinking aligns with any specific style. If you’re looking for something akin to IQ, intensity is your closest match — but it's based on your thinking pattern, not how well you perform under test conditions.

## Summary
IRGB isn’t about being right — it’s about being _you_.

Your color shows ***how*** you think.

Your intensity shows how ***clearly*** you think that way.

It’s not a replacement for IQ. It’s what IQ was _supposed_ to be.
